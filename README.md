# Getting Started with Google Maps API with Places autocomplete and Directions service and renderer.

Create an API in the google developers console [https://console.developers.google.com](https://console.developers.google.com), make sure to enable billing for the google project, otherwise you may get a warning as _development purposes only_.

Add a `.env` file or `.env.local` in the project root and specify your API key as `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

In the project directory, you can run:

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

OR using npm

```
npm install
npm start
```
